Face Liveness Detection System

Design and implement an AI-powered Face Liveness Detection system to prevent facial recognition spoofing attacks. The system should distinguish between real human faces and presentation attacks (photos, videos, masks) in real-time.
Background
Face recognition systems are vulnerable to presentation attacks where attackers use photos, video replays, or 3D masks to bypass security. Face liveness detection adds a critical security layer by verifying if the presented face belongs to a live person.
